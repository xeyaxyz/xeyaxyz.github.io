# XeyaRetirement - DeFi Retirement Calculator

A Solidity smart contract that calculates the required investment amount for pension planning using Pendle Finance yield-bearing instruments. The contract takes into account life expectancy, monthly spending requirements, and various financial parameters to determine the optimal investment strategy. **Once the target savings amount is reached, the contract automatically schedules and executes monthly payments to the user's wallet.**

## Features

- **Retirement Plan Calculation**: Calculate required investment amount based on life expectancy and monthly spending
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Accounts for inflation to maintain purchasing power over time
- **Yield Rate Integration**: Integrates with Pendle Finance yield rates for accurate calculations
- **Real-time Updates**: Update pension plans as circumstances change
- **Present Value Calculations**: Uses time value of money principles for accurate financial planning
- **ðŸ†• Automatic Monthly Payments**: Automatically schedules and executes monthly payments once target is reached
- **ðŸ†• Fund Management**: Track deposits, target amounts, and payment status
- **ðŸ†• Time-based Scheduling**: Enforces monthly payment intervals (30 days)
- **ðŸ†• Multi-user Support**: Each user has independent pension plans and payment schedules
- **ðŸ†• Modern Frontend**: Beautiful React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

   ```

5. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## How It Works

The smart contract uses the following formula to calculate the required investment:

1. **Present Value Calculation**: Each future monthly payment is discounted to present value using the real yield rate (nominal yield - inflation)
2. **Inflation Adjustment**: Monthly spending amounts are adjusted for inflation over the retirement period
3. **Life Expectancy**: Total retirement period is calculated based on life expectancy after retirement
4. **Investment Requirement**: Sum of all present values gives the total required investment
5. **ðŸ†• Automatic Payments**: Once the target amount is reached, monthly payments are automatically initiated and scheduled

### Payment Flow

1. **Create Retirement Plan**: User creates a retirement plan with their parameters
2. **Deposit Funds**: User deposits funds towards their target amount
3. **Target Reached**: When total deposits reach the calculated target, payments automatically start
4. **Monthly Payments**: Contract sends monthly payments to user's wallet every 30 days
5. **Payment Completion**: Payments continue until all scheduled payments are completed

### Key Parameters

- **Life Expectancy**: Years expected to live after retirement
- **Monthly Spending**: Required monthly income during retirement (in wei)
- **Retirement Age**: Age at which retirement begins
- **Current Age**: Current age of the person
- **Yield Rate**: Expected annual yield from Pendle Finance (in basis points, e.g., 500 = 5%)
- **Inflation Rate**: Expected annual inflation rate (in basis points, e.g., 200 = 2%)

## Example Usage

### Smart Contract
```javascript
// Example: Calculate required investment for a 30-year-old planning to retire at 65
// with 20 years life expectancy, $5000 monthly spending, 5% yield, 2% inflation

const requiredInvestment = await retirementCalculator.calculateRequiredInvestment(
    20,                    // Life expectancy years
    ethers.parseEther("5000"), // Monthly spending
    65,                    // Retirement age
    30,                    // Current age
    500,                   // 5% yield rate
    200                    // 2% inflation rate
);
```

### Frontend
```typescript
// Complete pension planning workflow
const data = {
  lifeExpectancyYears: 20,
  monthlySpending: 5000,
  retirementAge: 65,
  currentAge: 30,
  yieldRate: 5.0,
  inflationRate: 2.0
};

// Calculate and create plan
const amount = await calculateInvestment(data);
await createRetirementPlan(data);

// Deposit funds
await depositFunds(parseFloat(amount));
```

## Integration with Pendle Finance

The contract is designed to integrate with Pendle Finance yield-bearing instruments. Key integration points:

1. **Yield Rate Updates**: The contract owner can update yield rates from Pendle Finance
2. **Historical Data**: Stores historical yield rates for analysis
3. **Real-time Calculations**: Uses current yield rates for accurate calculations

### Pendle Finance Integration

To integrate with actual Pendle Finance data:

1. Implement an oracle or API call to fetch current Pendle Finance yield rates
2. Update the `getLatestYieldRate()` function to fetch real-time data
3. Set up automated yield rate updates using Chainlink or similar oracle

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Only the contract owner can update yield rates
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated to prevent invalid calculations
- **Safe Math**: Uses OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library to prevent overflow/underflow
- **Basis Points**: Uses basis points (1/100th of a percent) for precise rate calculations
- **ðŸ†• Reentrancy Protection**: Uses ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
- **ðŸ†• Payment Scheduling**: Enforces time-based payment intervals to prevent abuse
- **ðŸ†• Fund Safety**: Emergency withdrawal function for owner in critical situations

## Events

The contract emits the following events for tracking:

- `RetirementPlanCreated`: When a new retirement plan is created
- `RetirementPlanUpdated`: When a retirement plan is updated
- `YieldRateUpdated`: When yield rate is updated
- `ðŸ†• FundsDeposited`: When funds are deposited
- `ðŸ†• TargetReached`: When target amount is reached and payments start
- `ðŸ†• MonthlyPaymentSent`: When a monthly payment is sent
- `ðŸ†• PaymentsCompleted`: When all payments are completed
